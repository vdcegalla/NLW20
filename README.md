- Address used to access resources on the web (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).

### 🌍 IP (Internet Protocol)
- Identifies each device on the internet.
- Example: `rocketseat.com.br` → `123.32.1.23`.

### 🧭 DNS (Domain Name System)
- Translates domain names into IP addresses.

### 🎨 CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
